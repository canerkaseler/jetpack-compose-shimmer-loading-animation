This repository aims to show how to create a shimmer & shadow loading effect animation with native Jetpack Compose for light and dark modes in Android applications.

There is a [Medium Article](https://proandroiddev.com/shimmer-shadow-loading-effect-animation-with-jetpack-compose-f4b3de28dc2b). You can study this repository with the article.

## Description of Medium Article

I will create a basic Android application with only Jetpack Compose in this article. This app will include some general placeholders for some general use cases such as a news image, title, subtitle, user image, etc. In addition, the app will include two buttons. The first one is to start or stop the shimmer animation. Another one is to show dark mode shimmer loading animation.
